# Darya jalini
With over six years of experience in public relations, exhibitions, promotional gifts, design and print, my professional journey has always run alongside my artistic path.
Painting and design are not merely passions but have become fundamental parts of my professional identity.

What drives me forward is finding a common language with the audience, sometimes through a public relations campaign and sometimes within the frame of a work of art.
